# Quantifying the Dynamics of Recourse Generators

## What is this project?
This is an implementation of a framework described in my [Bachelor's thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Acb0bf4ac-4055-489b-b768-e5b53ec6fa47) which attempts to provide insight into the domain and model shifts induced by recourse generators. In my thesis, I work with the generators introduced by Wachter _et al._ and Mothilal _et al._, although, in principle, the framework allows for the comparison of the dynamics of any generator which implements the interface designed by [the CARLA framework](https://github.com/carla-recourse/CARLA).
